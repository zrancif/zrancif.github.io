            <h1>What is Novelette?</h1>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Novelette is a combination of project and enjoyment made by Franciz Despi. It was supposed to only have atleast three (3) html files but the enjoyment got out of hand. At first it was how to make the navigation bar, then proceeded to buttons, and then suddenly moved to animation, and finally came the "how-to-redirect" html thing.</p>
                <p>So yeah... That happened.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was a fun journey. I still want to add more but restrained myself. Maybe someday, I can continue this thing. There are still more big projects awaiting that needs to be prioritized.</p>
                <p>That's why... This will now be the end.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><p>"Ends will open up a path for a new beginnings."</p></h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><pre>Oh yeah! Puns Intended :> </pre></p>
