                <p>"Dang it!" He thought. Soaking wet, he ran through the busy streets of Naga. Getting up late, of course he was in panic. Not to mention, his dog chewed on his umbrella that's unrecognizable in its current state. Today wasn't really his day.</p>
                <p>Indeed, he was having a really bad day. In addition to his current upcomming, his late night cramming of a five page essay only added to his worries because it was due this morning. He hadn't even had his morning coffee yet.</p>
                <p>He finally arrived to his destination. Standing at the gate, not caring about the amount of water dripping from his hair nor how drenched he is. He had one last task, to submit.</p>
                <p>Just as he was about to enter until one maiden came rushing towards his direction. He tried to dodge but...</p>
                
                <h2>B A M !</h2>

                <p>The collision occured and caused him to fell over his notes. His hard work, now drenched on the floor, was lost. He fell in anguish as he looked at it and rage took over him.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Oh, come on! Can't you see where you'r-</p>
                    <p>"I'm so sorry!"</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>He looked at the maiden bowing before him. He had a realization.</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>It was her. The one he admires the most. The prettiest girl in the world.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>"I'll be going now. I'm really sorry about your work." The princess apologized again and left as her hair swung like it is dancing with the wind.</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>"Man, what a lovely day."</p>
                </blockquote>
