                <p>Two students of Nagha High were reported to be acting suspiciously behind the school cafeteria. According to the witnesses, two students were smuggling a prohibited item in the school inside the cafeteria. Their statement raised a flag on the Principal and proceeded to call the students in question to investigate.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Dehd and Marrie arrived to the Principal&#39;s Office and met the strict eyes of the school principal. The presence of security guards unnerved them and felt that they were walking on a tightrope. To be honest, they have no idea why they were called but the atmosphere in the room was suffocating.</p>



                <p>&#8220;I believe that you are confused as to why you are called here.&#8221;, the Principal stated, gaining agreeing nods from the two. &#8220;I have recieved a report that both of you have been involved in smuggling a prohibited item behind the school cafeteria.&#8221;</p>



                <p>Dehd wondered if there was someone who smuggled drugs in school. Marrie recollected her memory before informing Dehd which incident did the Principal is talking about. After Marrie informed Dehd, he was filled with emotions that was painted on his face. The face of sadness and betrayal.</p>



                <p>&#8220;It was Primly, isn&#39;t it?&#8221; Dehd asked before emotionally defends himself. &#8220;I swear it wasn&#39;t mine! I promise! It was already there when we found it. It was raining heavy that time. We need to get it to safety!&#8221;</p>



                <p>Dehd was panicking with the addition of fury but he continued. &#8220;So we took it and found a place behind the cafeteria where rain can&#39;t reach it and no one would take it. Primly and Edwyn was there too!&#8221;</p>



                <p>&#8220;Mister CRENTLY!&#8221; the Principal raised his voice, &#8220;Please calm your nerves down! This is not the way to speak with your principal! You should have called the authorities! You should know that DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL!&#8221;</p>



                <p>&#8220;BUT SIR&#8213;Wait...What do you mean Drugs?&#8221; Asked Dehd, which made the Principal confused and realized something is very wrong in the conversation.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Filled with confusion, the Principal decided to call the witnesses, Edwyn Shmert and Culfret Primly, for clarifications.</p>

                <br>

                <p><h2>&#8249; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; &#171; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#187; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; &#8250;</h2></p>

                <p>The audible laughs of the security guards can be heard from the outside of the Principal&#39;s Office. Dehd, Marrie, Edwyn and Primly looked at each other with unreadable faces.</p>



                <p>&#8220;You know, this whole thing is your fault.&#8221;, Edwyn told Primly with a straight face.</p>



                <p>Primly took offense on that and replied, &#8220;YOU KNOW VERY WELL how WORDS COME OUT of MY MOUTH! You&#39;re in no position to talk.&#8221;</p>



                <p>&#8220;You too Dehd.&#8221;, Marrie pointed. "this wouldn&#39;t have grown into this big pile of situation if you stop referring to the cat &#39;it&#39;.&#8221;</p>



                <p>&#8220;Well, EXCUUUUUSE ME for not knowing WHAT THE HECK IS THE CAT&#39;S GENDER AND BEING CONFUSED WHETHER I SHOULD CALL IT &#39;HE&#39; or &#39;SHE&#39;!&#8221;, Dehd snarked at them.</p>



                <p>While absorbed in their conversation, they didn&#39;t notice their adviser who came to pick them up from the front of the Principal&#39;s Office arrive. When suddenly, a certain pot-mouth audibly and confidently stated that&#8213;</p>

                <strong><p>&#8220;You can see &#39;em BALLS!&#8221;</p></strong>
